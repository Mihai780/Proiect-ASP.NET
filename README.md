Website that allows users to post content, save it in personal categories and like and comment on it
Created on a local database, not deployed for public use
Language: Romanian

# How does it work? 

You can view posts if you don't have an unregistered account, but that's pretty much it. In order to access all other features, you must have a registered account

A registered user can create posts, comment and like on any post and create personal categories to save posts in them.

An user profile contains a nickname, their mail address(which is their username), a profile photo and other features. You can also see posts which they have saved.

# Moderation?

There is an Administrator role that can edit and/or delete malicious posts, profiles and even categories
